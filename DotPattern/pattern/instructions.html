<p>We are going to play a fun game where you have to remember a pattern and recreate it by placing stickers on the correct squares!</p>
<p>Look closely at the pattern you will see, because you need to remember it to recreate it correctly.</p>
<p>You will have 10 seconds to remember the pattern and 60 seconds to recreate it.</p>
<p>When you are ready, press "Next" to start the task.</p>

<p>Choose the color you like best for the pattern before we proceed:</p>

<!-- Include jscolor library -->
<script src="https://jscolor.com/release/2.4.5/jscolor.js"></script>

<!-- Color picker input tied to the player's form field -->
<input class="jscolor" id="colorPicker" name="selected_color" value="{{ player.selected_color }}" />

<p>After choosing a color, click "Next" to continue.</p>
